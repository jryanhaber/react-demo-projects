## array destructuring

React now offers useState in its hooks
useState has other functions like activeIndex and setActiveIndex

Old school methods for writing this, and then gradual refactors

```const things = useState(null)
const activeIndex = things[0]
const setActiveIndex = things[1]
```

 - this approach will pull in the function imported off of the react library of functions, then pull the functions out of it, which are in an array format, and assign them to variables, using the array structure to determine which are being pointed at in variable assignment

 - but you can also skip the first step, and direcly assign the variables through array destructuring

``` [ activeIndex: activeIndex, setActiveIndex:setActiveIndex ] = useState(null)
```
  - plus, since the names of the variables are identical in the new array to the function names, you can even skip the assignment because

  ```
  activeIndex
  activeIndex: activeIndex
  ```

   - are identical in compilation time when declared within an array

   so the entire statement can be reduced further to

```   [ activeIndex, setActiveIndex ] = useState(null)
```
   Which pulls useState from 'react', pulls activeIndex and setActiveIndex from useState, and assigns those functions by name to whatever functions are then downstream from the declaration.  

   Very concise!


# Template used


## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
